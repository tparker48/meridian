## Meridian
Survival roguelike FPS, based loosely on Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian

You awake in a desert: featureless, uninviting, quivering under a rising red sun. Your campfire has gone out during the night and from it erects a thin column of smoke towards the burnt sky. To your side is a scrawny mule. You have an empty canteen, a few handfuls of corn, and a pistol with 3 bullets. Your clothes are torn, tattered, makeshift, and dusty. You are pursued by a mysterious rider, and will continue as such for the remainder of your life. If you stop for too long or move too slowly through this harsh land, he will find you. At night, you see his campfires in the distance, and in day you see the dust from his horse as he pursues. He’s in no hurry, he knows he will catch you eventually. The loud, ominous drone of a horn sounds in the distance, and a group of scavenger birds shriek and fly off nearby. These are the sounds that mark the beginning of your cursed journey.

The mule will not carry you quickly, but it will save you from quick dehydration as you travel. It requires food and water and is near death, as is it’s rider. Your pistol shoots wild, and it’s rusted iron sights are mere suggestions for the next bullet’s path. Altercations with other travelers will prove extremely dangerous, and should be entered with caution. A single shot, even to an extremity, could prove your end. The people you meet will vary in disposition, but be assured: lively conversation will be rare.
